4.3.1    Scenario ?introduction

The core DevOps scenario is described thus:

*_Develop and deploy software functionality from development to
operations in a maximally automated model, with sustainable velocity and
demonstrating effective feedback._*

There are many references cited in this document on the origins and
current thinking around DevOps.

A variety of sources [link:REF_32[32-36]] suggest some common
architectural elements, named here as encountered:

* Source Repository

* Software Configuration Management

* Continuous Integration and Build Management

* Release Management

* Build Console

* Test Management

* Package Repository

* Deployment Engine

* Deployment Console

* Infrastructure Manager

* Configuration Management Database

* Event Management

* Element Management

* Business Process Management

Note that these elements have not been rationalized; there are overlaps.

In terms of scenarios, Eric Minick (formerly of UrbanCode, now of IBM)
suggests a set of overlapping, cumulative DevOps scenarios
[link:REF_33[33]] including:

* Build software

* Deploy software

* System testing on deployment

* Continuous delivery with monitoring and rollback

We will adopt this set of scenarios.

Note that this scenario does not include infrastructure as code.

4.3.2    Process flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the overall goal of DevOps is integrated software delivery and
deployment, it is possible to break this down into a set of smaller
building blocks which makes the problem more manageable.

*It is critical in reading these scenarios to understand that they are
intended to be run frequently and iteratively. Without that
understanding, the critical Agile goals of fast feedback and maximizing
information are not realized.*

4.3.2.1     Build software
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this scenario software is constructed, tested, incorporated into a
mainline trunk, and built into releasable packages on an ongoing basis.
This is the basic Continuous Integration use case.

Reading the diagram from left to right:

1.    First, code is checked into the Service Development Component,
which equates to Source Control and any additional services.

2.    This triggers workflow to start the new build. This may be done
immediately, or on a batch basis (i.e. the ?nightly build.?)

3.    The Build Management component, performing Continuous Integration,
runs tests (invoking the Test Management Component), including
functional unit tests as well as external static analysis if called for.
Test execution may result in defects being logged.

4.    If the build succeeds, the built package is stored in the Release
Design Component (aka package repository).

4.3.2.2     Deploy software
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this scenario software is pulled from the package repository and
applied to target environments in a repeatable

image:../images/image019.png[image]

1.    First, some event (automated, e.g. from a successful build, or
human initiated) has initiated the deployment process.

2.    A proposed change has been submitted to and approved by the Change
Control component (this may be a standard change and approved in an
automated manner)

3.    The actual artifacts/package are pulled from the Release Design
Component into the Deployment Management System(s) and applied to the
Target System

4.    The CMDB Component is updated as required with any new
dependencies or other information originating from the package manifest.

Notes:

* This is the point at which OSLC or TOSCA [link:REF_37[37]]
may come into play.

4.3.2.3     System testing on deployment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this scenario system level tests are applied to the deployed
packages.

image:../images/image020.png[image] +

1.    Per the last scenario, some event has resulted in the deployment
of software to a target system.

2.    The Test Management Component executes system-level, integration,
and/or performance tests against the target system (which may be any
environment).

3.    Results (as in the first scenario) are recorded in the Defect
Management Component.

The reader may note that Incident Management is not included in this
scenario; it is in the next one.

 

4.3.2.4     Continuous delivery with monitoring and rollback
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This scenario applies monitoring, event management, and automated
rollback to the previous.

image:../images/image021.png[image]

1.    The software is now deployed into an environment with some level
of operational monitoring, starting at the lowest ?service monitoring?
level ? e.g., probes and log monitors that detect the basic operational
status of the managed element.

2.    The service monitoring component then raises events into an event
management component (sometimes called a ?manager of managers.?)

3.    The Event Management component draws upon CMDB dependencies and
its own business rules to determine if an actual Incident should be
declared.

4.    The Incident is declared, and if severe enough, may warrant
rollback of the change.

5.    The proposed rollback of the Change is approved via the Change
Control component

6.    The Deployment Management system then reverses the change.

7.    (Not shown) Root cause analysis and remediation then are presumed
to occur.

Notes:

* There are various patterns for the roles that element
monitors, event managers, and incident systems play, but a three-tier
pattern is often seen.?

* The term ?Service Monitoring Component? is a bit of a
misnomer, as true service-awareness is not understood at the element or
system level, but rather require the dependencies from the CMDB.

 

4.3.2.5     DevOps interpreted as an ITSM ?flow

This is an auxiliary view of the end to end flow, interpreted as ITSM?
?processes.

4.3.2.6     ??? DevOps interpreted as a SAFe flow

This scenario will contrast with the previous scenario and represent the
end to end delivery in SAFe terminology.

_Note: If we bring in SAFE capabilities, we may need two capability
?namespaces? ? need to discuss._

4.3.2.7     DevOps and infrastructure-centric use cases

In scope?

4.3.2.8     DevOps pipeline as an ITSM? ?flow with key data objects
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Key question: is there a ?Release? data object independent of the
?Release Package? ? the ?Release? being metadata to the actual contents
of the ?Release Package???
