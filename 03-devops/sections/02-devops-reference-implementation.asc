= DevOps reference implementaton

An initial reference implementation of the DevOps scenario was undertaken using free and open source software [citation to Calavera project]. Products employed included:

|====
| Product           | Role
| Ubuntu Linux      | operating system
| Vagrant           | virtual environment
| Chef Zero         | virtual server provisioning
| Java              | programming language &                    interpreter
| JUnit             | automated testing framework
| Apache Ant        | language-specific build tool
| Apache Tomcat     | application server
| git               | source control repository
| Jenkins           | build choreography tool
| Artifactory       | package repository
|====

The purpose of this effort was to ensure that the DevOps scenario was well grounded in technical fundamentals. Abstractions (e.g. "source code control") need to have concrete examples, and interactions suggested by graphical lines need to be traceable to actual system relationships.

The initial version of the pipeline explored the relationship between development, testing, and production environments. The following features were deferred to future versions:

* Source code QA (e.g. static analysis)
* Defect and issue tracking
* Integration testing

There were a number of learnings and insights generated by this effort:

* The importance of representing subject systems and environments

* Clarifying the relationship between artfifact and data object

** Maven coordinates and semantic versioning

* Relationship between source and package repository
