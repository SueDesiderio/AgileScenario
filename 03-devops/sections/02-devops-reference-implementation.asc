= DevOps reference implementaton

An initial reference implementation of the DevOps scenario was undertaken using free and open source software [citation to Calavera project]. Products employed included:

| Product           | Role
| Ubuntu Linux      | operating system
| Vagrant           | virtual environment
| Chef Zero         | virtual server provisioning
| Java              | programming language &                    interpreter
| JUnit             | automated testing framework
| Apache Ant        | language-specific build tool
| Apache Tomcat     | application server
| git               | source control repository
| Jenkins           | build choreography tool
| Artifactory       | package repository
|====

The purpose of this effort was to ensure that the DevOps scenario was well grounded in technical fundamentals.

The initial version of the pipeline explored the relationship between development, testing, and prodcution environments. The following features were deferred to future versions:

* Source code QA (e.g. static analysis)
* Defect and issue tracking
* Integration testing
